This is the primary client for the [ResiAPI](https://lordvertice.hopto.org/LordVertice/resi-api). This Discord bot (and possibly other projects) can access the API to store important information about our members, in order to keep track of changing usernames and to connect a member's Discord username with their Minecraft UUID.
